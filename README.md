# Corkboard
This project will potentially be an alternative to discord, as in a chat webpage that can be used by Clover Park students to allow for easier ways to connect with eachother, make hobby groups, make study groups with classmates and more!
<br>
<br>
Currently this project is going to be changing in various ways but the hope will be the project can be worked on by students, for students, with the ability to expand the concept in a variety of ways.

## Features
These are the work in progess features that the team has come up with so far, more may be added as the project grows:
- Account system that can be connected to Clover Park in a secure and trusted way allowing for easy way to identify fellow students for gatherings
- "Hubs" which will be similar to the servers found on discord
- Live text chat in and out of the "Hubs" allowing for more fluid ways to communicate with students both in and out of class
- Ability to make Hobby Hubs or Study Hubs

### Potential Features
These are more nebulous ideas that could be implemented further on by other students in the future:
- Ability to host a class similar to Zoom but with the live text chat allowing for easier class interactions for online labs and lectures
- Built in recording capability for online labs and lectures
- Faculty/instructor sections with ways to intergrate into other platforms such as canvas for having group work during online labs
- Not technically a feature but to allow for Corkboard to open up more into a wider program so other colleges could use as well

## Contributors
For this section, I, Alex E, wanted to make something like a small note for future students who think that this project could be a cool idea to work on and develop so I thought adding a list of names for each team that has worked on this project, if you don't want to fair's fair but I just thought as non-professional as it may seem it's still cool to see how a small idea can grow and change.
